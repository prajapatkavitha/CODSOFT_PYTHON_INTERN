This repository contains the Python projects developed as part of my internship .
These projects are aimed at honing my programming skills in Python and applying various concepts in real-world applications.
The projects included are:
1. To-Do List Application
2. Calculator  
3. Password Generator
4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
   
Project 1: To-Do List Application
Description:
A simple command-line To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks.
Users can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from their list.

Features:
Add tasks to the list.
View all pending and completed tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks from the list.
Store tasks in a simple text file for persistence.

How to Run:
1.Download the todo_list.py file.
2.Run the script using Python:

Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional external libraries are required. All dependencies are included in the standard Python library.


Project 2: Calculator

Description:
A simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The user can input numbers and select the operation they want to perform.

Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Clear input button to reset the calculations.
- Display of the result after each operation.

How to Run:
1. Download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python:

 Project 3: Password Generator
 
Description:
A secure password generator that creates random passwords of a specified length. 
The generated passwords include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,
and special characters to ensure strong security.

Features:
Generate passwords of customizable lengths.
Password includes a mix of characters for enhanced security.
Option to exclude certain characters or symbols.

How to Run:

2.Run the script using Python

Project 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description:
A command-line version of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the user competes against the computer.
The computer's move is generated randomly, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

Features:
Play against the computer.
Random computer move generation.
Option to play multiple rounds.
Display of the game result (Win, Lose, Draw).

How to Run:
1.Download the rock_paper_scissors.py file.
2.Run the script using Python:

Conclusion
This collection of Python projects represents the skills I have developed during my internship at Codsoft. 
Each project helped me practice key programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, file handling,
user input, and random number generation. I'm continuously looking to enhance my Python programming abilities 
and build more complex applications.
